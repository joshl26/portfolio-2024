# Use of Hexadecimal Numbers in Computer Science


## How do we define a hexadecimal number system?

The hexadecimal numeral system is a method of representing numbers using a base 
of sixteen. Unlike the decimal system, which uses ten symbols to represent values 
from zero to nine, hexadecimal uses sixteen symbols, including "0" to "9" for 
values zero to nine, and "A" to "F" (or "a" to "f") for values ten to fifteen.

### Example

<Callout emoji="üí°">

In the hexadecimal system the number 1234 is represented as:

<br/>

4 D 2

<br/>

(4x16¬≤) + (13x16¬π) + (2x16‚Å∞)

<br/>

1024 + 208 + 2 = 1234

<br/>

Where 16‚Å∞ = 1.

## Why do we use hexadecimal number systems?

To answer this question we need to look at how data is stored in a
computers memory.

## How is data stored in a computers memory?

Binary numbers (base-2), which computers fundamentally use, tend to be long 
and cumbersome. Hexadecimal (base-16) numbers are much shorter, making them 
easier to read and write. Each hex digit represents four binary digits (bits), 
so a single byte (8 bits) can be represented by just two hex digits.

## Ok, so we can use hexadecimal numbers to simplify working with memory. 
## What else can we do with them? 

### Human Readability

Hexadecimal numbers are easier for humans to read and interpret than binary 
numbers. Many computer scientists and engineers find it simpler to work with 
smaller hex numbers compared to lengthy binary strings.

### Eliminating Redundancy

Hexadecimal offers a high-density representation of data. For example, while 
a 32-bit binary number requires 32 digits to write out, the same number can 
be represented by just 8 hex digits, thus saving space and reducing the potential 
for errors when reading or transcribing.

### Memory Address

Memory addresses in computing are typically long binary numbers, but representing 
these in hex simplifies their notation. This is particularly useful in debugging, 
where memory locations and contents are commonly displayed.

### Easy Conversion to Binary

Converting between binary and hexadecimal is straightforward. Each hex digit 
corresponds directly to a four-bit binary sequence, making the conversion process 
simple and fast. For example, the binary sequence 1010 1100 can be quickly converted 
to the hex value AC.

### Intuitive Mapping to a Byte in Memory

Given that hexadecimal digits map neatly to four-bit nibbles (a half-byte), hexadecimals 
align perfectly with the byte-oriented architecture of modern computers. This alignment 
facilitates various low-level programming tasks, such as setting flags and manipulating 
memory.

### Standardization

Hexadecimal numbers have become a standard way to denote binary data in documentation, 
programming, and networking. For instance, color codes in web design, machine code for 
microprocessors, and IP addresses in certain contexts use hex notation, making it a 
universally understood format among professionals.

#### IP Address

### Debugging and Diagnostics

Tools like debuggers and hex editors display data in hexadecimal format because it allows 
developers to quickly recognize patterns, offsets, and memory addresses. This is particularly 
useful when dealing with low-level system data or interfacing directly with hardware.

### Checksum and Hash Functions

Algorithms that produce checksums, hashes, and cryptographic keys often output results in 
hexadecimal format for more compact and readable representations. This is practical for 
ensuring data integrity and security.

### Historical contexts

Historically, hexadecimal has been used in various programming languages and platforms 
(such as assembly languages and older mainframe systems) due to its efficiency and effectiveness. 
This legacy continues to influence its ongoing usage in modern computing.

## Summary

In summary, the hexadecimal number system strikes a balance between the binary system used 
internally by computers and the need for a more compact, readable, and manipulable format 
for humans. Its ease of conversion, alignment with the binary system, and widespread adoption 
make it indispensable in computer science.
