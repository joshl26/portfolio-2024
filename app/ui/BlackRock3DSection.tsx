            BlackRock3D is a wordpress site that was designed by Joshua Lehman
            in 2018 to showcase his skills in Engineering. This turned out to be
            the final catalyst in making me want to switch careers into software
            engineering.
          </p>
          <p className="portfolio-p">
            This site was created as an introduction to the world of WordPress
            CMS and web development in 2017 by Joshua Lehman. There are many
            stories on this site describing previous engineering projects that I
            have worked on. Including explanations of how those projects
            provided solutions to solve real world problems by utilizing my
            background in Engineering, Mathematics and Science.
          </p>
          <p className="portfolio-p">
            There is also a tutorial section on the site dedicated to
            Programming (HTML, CSS, JavaScript,â€¦) where I cover the basics
            through to more advanced topics. Many tutorials include some kind of
            interactive content to help reinforce concepts. My goal with this
            site is to provide interactive content, that educates and entertains
            at the same time. Have fun looking around and feel free to drop me a
            line if you have any questions or comments.

          <p className="portfolio-p">
            Developing a seamless interface between the frontend inputs and
            backend processing logic required meticulous debugging during the
            initial stages. Ensuring privacy while handling confidential user
            information prompted the implementation of advanced security
            protocols early in development.
          </p>
          <p className="portfolio-p">
            One significant obstacle in this project involved integrating
            real-time job data fetching mechanisms from various sources while
            maintaining quick response times for end-users. Another challenge
            was ensuring that personalized content generation maintained
            accuracy in matching candidate skill sets with job demands while
            producing engaging narratives within cover letters.
          </p>
          <p className="portfolio-p">
            I successfully addressed these challenges by utilizing sophisticated
            algorithmic approaches combined with current web technologies,
            making Resume Wrangler highly efficient yet straightforward enough
            for non-techie users.
